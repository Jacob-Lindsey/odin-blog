### Rules of the game

* **Pass Line**

  An even money bet, made on the first roll of the dice (known as the “come out roll”). You win if a 7 or 11 roll, or lose if 2, 3, or 12 roll (known as “craps”). Any other number that rolls becomes the “point” and the point must roll again before a 7 to win.

* **Don't Pass Line**
 
  An even money bet, which is the opposite of the pass line. You lose on the “come out” roll if the shooter rolls a 7 or 11. You win on a 2 or 3 (12 is a tie). Once a point is established, you lose if the point is thrown and win if a 7 rolls.
